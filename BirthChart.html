  <!-- PARAGRAPHS DESCRIBING THE PAGE AND THE PURPOSE OF NATAL CHARTS VERY LOOSELY -->
  <p>A natal chart is an astrological reading of your stars dependent on the
    date, time, and location you were born in that is said to predict
    a person's character and potential.</p>

  <p>Have a go at it yourself if you know your birth time and location, you
    might discover a thing or two about yourself. Astrological readings go beyond
    a simple chart and can show more complex information such as the exact locations
    that unlock your potential in different aspect of life, or the other signs you should
    look to to know who you work well with and who you do not. It is quite an enjoyable activity
    to do with friends and know how well you compliment each other's personalities astrologically.</p>
